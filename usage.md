the C++ masm compiler/interpreter combo is designed to be used in the creation of other Micro-Assembly runtimes.

though it can be used standalone, it's main use is to be used as a library in other projects for making micro-assembly runtimes that can use their language for MNI bindings.

MNI or Micro-Assembly Native Interface is a way to bind micro-assembly code to the host language, allowing for the ability to write native code in micro-assembly for the target host language.

it's dependent on the host language, but the idea is to allow for the ability to write native code in micro-assembly for the target host language.
